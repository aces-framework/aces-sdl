# Scenario Description Language (SDL) Reference

The ACES SDL is a YAML-based specification language for describing cyber range scenarios and experiments. It starts from the [Open Cyber Range SDL](https://github.com/Open-Cyber-Range/SDL-parser) surface, preserves coverage across the OCR-derived sections, and extends that base with additional scenario concepts such as content, accounts, relationships, agents, objectives, workflows, and variables. It is intentionally its own SDL rather than a clone-level derivative.

The SDL describes *what the scenario and experiment mean* — not how to deploy
or execute it directly. Backend implementations realize SDL specifications
through the runtime contracts defined here. The
repository now includes SDL-native instantiation, compilation, planning,
contracts, and a reference control-plane surface; the broader backend ecosystem
and production implementations are still evolving.

The raw YAML document is only the entrypoint. The SDL's semantic behavior is
defined above that syntax layer through typed SDL models, semantic validation,
and the runtime/compiler/planner contracts. The repository-wide policy for when
to formalize those semantic layers lives in the
[coding standards](../reference/coding-standards.md).

Different SDL concerns also draw from different precedent families. OCR is the
main source for the section surface, CACAO contributes objectives/workflows and
variables, and the workflow/runtime semantics are further disciplined by mature
control-flow systems such as Step Functions, Argo, and SCXML plus portable
runtime-boundary patterns from systems such as Kubernetes and Temporal. The
crosswalk lives in [Design Precedents](precedents.md).

## Stable IDs, Variable Values

The SDL keeps its **symbol table** concrete at parse time. User-defined identifiers such as node keys, feature keys, account keys, relationship keys, entity keys, and other named mapping keys are part of the language structure and must be literal.

Variables are for **attribute values** on already-declared things. That includes fields such as counts, ports, CIDRs, paths, timings, descriptions, and similar runtime-substituted values.

In other words:

- `nodes: {web: ...}` — `web` is a stable SDL identifier
- `content.hostname-file.text: ${hostname}` — `${hostname}` is a variable-backed attribute value

This means a hostname, IP, path, or display string can be variable-backed, but a node cannot be created or renamed through `${...}` inside a mapping key.

Generic cross-section refs such as relationship endpoints and objective targets accept either:

- bare names like `webapp` when the name is unambiguous
- qualified refs like `nodes.webapp`, `features.nginx`, `accounts.db-admin`, or `infrastructure.dmz-net` when disambiguation is needed

Named service bindings, named ACL rules, and workflow steps keep their existing qualified forms.

## Quick Example

```yaml
name: simple-pentest-lab
description: Web app with SQL injection targeting a database

nodes:
  lab-net:
    type: Switch
  webapp:
    type: VM
    os: linux
    resources: {ram: 2 gib, cpu: 1}
    features: [flask-app]
    services: [{port: 8080, name: http}]
    vulnerabilities: [sqli]
  database:
    type: VM
    os: linux
    resources: {ram: 1 gib, cpu: 1}
    features: [postgres]
    services: [{port: 5432, name: postgresql}]
    asset_value: {confidentiality: high}

infrastructure:
  lab-net: {count: 1, properties: {cidr: 10.0.0.0/24, gateway: 10.0.0.1}}
  webapp: {count: 1, links: [lab-net]}
  database: {count: 1, links: [lab-net]}

features:
  flask-app: {type: Service, source: vulnerable-flask-app}
  postgres: {type: Service, source: postgresql-16}

vulnerabilities:
  sqli:
    name: SQL Injection
    description: SQLi in login form
    technical: true
    class: CWE-89

relationships:
  app-to-db:
    type: connects_to
    source: flask-app
    target: postgres

accounts:
  db-admin:
    username: admin
    node: database
    password_strength: weak

## Usage

```python
from aces.core.sdl import parse_sdl, parse_sdl_file

# From a string
scenario = parse_sdl(yaml_string)

# From a file
scenario = parse_sdl_file(Path("scenarios/my-scenario.yaml"))

# Skip semantic validation (structural only)
scenario = parse_sdl(yaml_string, skip_semantic_validation=True)

# Non-fatal authoring advisories
for advisory in scenario.advisories:
    print(advisory)
```

## Format Boundary

This repository accepts SDL documents only. Older metadata/mode-based scenario
formats are out of scope and must be migrated before parsing.
