# Runtime Architecture: SDL -> Runtime Model -> Composite Plans

This document describes the runtime layer that sits directly on top of the SDL.
It is an SDL-native runtime architecture built for the SDL itself and its
backend contracts. See
[ADR-004](../adrs/adr-004-sdl-runtime-layer.md) for the decision record.

Under the repository's [coding standards](../reference/coding-standards.md),
this layer is where `FM2` and `FM3` work becomes most relevant. The
formalization target here is not raw YAML, but the typed runtime model and the
contracts that preserve semantic meaning across validation, compilation,
planning, and backend execution.

This layer also draws from a different precedent set than the author-facing SDL
surface. OCR and CACAO still matter, but the strongest implementation models
here come from mature workflow and distributed-runtime systems:

- AWS Step Functions, Argo Workflows, and W3C SCXML for explicit control-flow
  semantics
- Kubernetes, Temporal, and OpenC2 for portable execution-state and
  language-neutral contract boundaries

## Runtime Stages

### 1. Instantiate + Compile

`instantiate_scenario(raw_scenario, parameters=None, profile=None)` is now the
repo-owned concretization pass that runs before compilation.

It:

- applies explicit parameter values
- applies SDL variable defaults
- rejects unresolved `${var}` placeholders
- rebuilds a fully concrete `InstantiatedScenario`

`compile_runtime_model(scenario)` then normalizes the instantiated scenario
into runtime objects.

It separates reusable definitions from bound runtime instances:

- `features` -> feature templates
- `node.features` -> node-scoped feature bindings
- `conditions` -> condition templates
- `node.conditions` -> node-scoped condition bindings
- `injects` -> first-class orchestration inject resources
- `node.injects` -> optional node-scoped inject bindings layered on top of top-level inject resources
- `nodes` + `infrastructure` -> deployable network/node resources
- orchestration and scoring/objective sections -> resolved runtime programs and graph nodes

The output is a `RuntimeModel` with canonical addresses for every runtime-owned
object.

Bound condition refs fail closed. An unqualified condition reference must
resolve to exactly one bound runtime instance; zero matches and multiple matches
are both compile-time diagnostics. Event inject refs resolve directly to
top-level inject resources and fail if the named inject does not exist.
Bound feature dependencies also fail closed: if a node-scoped feature binding
declares a dependency on another feature that is not bound on the same node,
the compiler emits a diagnostic instead of silently dropping that dependency.

Compiled workflows are no longer just flattened successor maps. `WorkflowRuntime`
now preserves:

- `start_step`
- optional workflow timeout policy in the compiled execution contract
- per-step structured semantics (`objective`, `decision`, `switch`, `retry`, `call`, `parallel`, `join`, `end`)
- explicit call targets and ordered switch-case predicates
- explicit control edges
- external predicate dependencies
- prior-step state dependencies
- declared workflow feature usage
- a compiled `result_contract` for step-visible state
- a compiled `execution_contract` for workflow-level state/history validation

Workflow control is the flagship current `FM3` surface:

- it has explicit branching and re-entry behavior
- it defines portable execution-visible state
- it relies on reachability and visibility guarantees across multiple layers

That means workflow changes should be treated as state-machine work on the
runtime model and contracts, not merely as YAML authoring changes.

The intent is not to clone any one system. The SDL keeps its own
objective-centric workflow surface, but its semantics deliberately follow the
best-practice pattern from mature systems: explicit branching semantics,
explicit convergence rules, typed observable state, and a runtime contract that
is portable across backend implementations.

### 2. Plan

`plan(runtime_model, manifest, snapshot, target_name=None)` is also pure.

It validates semantic backend requirements and reconciles desired runtime
objects against the current `RuntimeSnapshot`.

`ExecutionPlan` is composite:

- `ProvisioningPlan` for deployable resources and bindings
- `OrchestrationPlan` for events, scripts, stories, workflows, and inject state
- `EvaluationPlan` for condition bindings, scoring graph nodes, and objectives

Each plan is provenance-bound to:

- an optional target name
- the backend manifest used for validation
- the base snapshot it was reconciled against

Direct planner output is unbound by default. Only `RuntimeManager.plan()` or an
explicit `target_name=` bind a plan to a concrete runtime target for apply.

Reconciliation actions are explicit:

- `CREATE`
- `UPDATE`
- `DELETE`
- `UNCHANGED`

Runtime resources carry two dependency sets:

- `ordering_dependencies`: same-domain edges used for create/start ordering and reverse delete ordering
- `refresh_dependencies`: edges whose changes force downstream `UPDATE`

Cross-domain refs participate in refresh propagation, but not startup ordering.
This keeps the fixed phase order intact while still making downstream plans
honestly react to upstream changes.
Ordering graphs must remain acyclic within each domain; the planner emits error
diagnostics and invalidates the plan if a cycle survives into runtime planning.

## Runtime Snapshot

`RuntimeSnapshot` is the typed state model used by the planner and manager. Each
entry records:

- canonical address
- domain
- resource type
- resolved payload
- ordering dependencies
- refresh dependencies
- current status

This gives the planner and manager a typed state model instead of an untyped
`resources/status` map.

## Capability Validation

Backends declare a `BackendManifest` composed of:

- `ProvisionerCapabilities`
- `OrchestratorCapabilities`
- zero or one `EvaluatorCapabilities`

Validation is semantic, not section-only. Current checks include:

- node types
- OS families
- total deployable node count
- ACL usage
- content types
- account features
- orchestration/workflow usage
- fine-grained workflow feature usage (`decision`, `retry`, `parallel` barriers, failure transitions)
- workflow predicate condition refs
- workflow predicate prior-step state refs and state-predicate subfeatures (`outcome-matching`, `attempt-counts`)
- scoring/objective usage

`OrchestratorCapabilities` now expose both coarse workflow support and fine-grained workflow semantics:

- `supports_workflows`
- `supports_condition_refs`
- `supported_workflow_features`
- `supported_workflow_state_predicates`

Capability validation now operates on concrete instantiated values rather than
placeholder domains guessed by backends. This removes the old “defer until
instantiation” gap for runtime-relevant fields such as `nodes.os` and
`infrastructure.count`.

## Runtime Target Lifecycle

Targets must provide an explicit manifest. The registry separates capability
inspection from instantiation, and `create()` uses the manifest returned by
`manifest()` as its single source of truth:

- `registry.manifest(name, **config)`
- `registry.create(name, **config)`

`RuntimeManager` drives lifecycle in this order:

1. compile
2. plan
3. validate provisioning apply
4. apply provisioning plan
5. start evaluator only when the evaluation plan has actionable operations
6. start orchestrator only when the orchestration plan has actionable operations
7. on failed runtime-service startup, roll back started services while keeping provisioning state
8. stop orchestrator -> stop evaluator -> delete provisioning resources

The orchestration runtime contract now includes:

- a plain-data workflow execution-state envelope
- a plain-data workflow history stream
- a compiled `result_contract` for step-visible state
- a compiled `execution_contract` for workflow-level legality/history validation
- control-plane operations for canceling running workflows and reconciling timeout expiry
- explicit compensation status/history when a workflow declares rollback behavior

Backends report portable execution envelopes rather than backend-native object
identity. The manager validates raw backend payloads against the compiled
contracts, not against incidental planner payload structure. Compiled workflow
predicates are fully typed runtime data; orchestrators should not rely on raw
SDL `spec` to execute workflow semantics.

Python typed workflow result models remain useful internally, but only as
normalization helpers after boundary validation. They are not the backend
protocol.

This is also why semantic modeling belongs here: backend-agnostic guarantees
such as allowed transitions, result visibility, and portability of workflow
state are runtime-contract questions, not parser questions.

This mirrors the contract style used by mature multi-runtime systems:

- a portable wire/data contract at the boundary
- a compiled semantic contract between definition and execution
- published machine-readable JSON Schemas under `schemas/`
- an async-style control-plane surface (`RuntimeControlPlane`) that can be
  adapted to HTTPS/JSON without changing backend semantics
- typed in-process adapters behind that boundary

The stack currently applies that pattern first to workflow results because workflow
control is the sharpest semantic surface in the SDL/runtime stack.

The evaluator side is now following the same contract discipline: compiled
evaluation result/execution contracts are attached to observable evaluation
resources, backends report plain-data evaluator result envelopes and history
streams, and the manager validates those payloads against compiled contracts
instead of accepting ad hoc evaluation dictionaries.

Objective `window` refs remain declarative scope/refresh inputs. They can force
objective refresh when referenced orchestration state changes, but they do not
create executor ordering edges across domains.

Objective windows now compile through one shared normalized semantic form. The
compiler preserves explicit resolved window references alongside the existing
address sets so later planner/runtime work can reason from canonical reference
identities instead of reparsing raw SDL strings.

Planner FM2 semantics are also now explicit rather than incidental:

- `ordering` edges define create/start and delete/teardown order
- `refresh` edges define recomputation/update propagation
- refresh propagation is transitive over the refresh graph
- cross-domain refresh does not create startup ordering

Those rules are owned by `aces.core.semantics.planner`, not by local planner
algorithm shape.

This phase is also intentionally composition-ready. Module/import expansion now
happens before semantic validation and compile, so the runtime layer operates
only on canonical resolved identities rather than on source-file layout. That
same foundation is what makes namespaced reusable workflow calls portable.

Composition is now registry-ready as well:

- local imports remain supported through `path:` and `source: local:...`
- reusable remote modules use `source: oci:...`
- concrete resolved imports may be pinned via `source: locked:...`
- `aces sdl resolve` writes `aces.lock.json`
- `aces sdl verify-imports` verifies lockfile, trust, digests, and signatures
- `aces sdl publish` packages a publishable SDL module as an OCI image layout

Resolution and trust happen before instantiation and semantic validation, but
planner/runtime semantics still see only one fully expanded canonical scenario.

`RuntimeManager.apply()` requires the plan provenance to match the manager:

- plan must be target-bound
- same target name
- same manifest
- same base snapshot

This prevents applying a plan against a different runtime target or a stale
snapshot than the one it was reconciled against.

`RuntimeTarget` is self-validating at construction time:

- manifest presence and component shape must match
- required protocol methods must exist
- those methods must be invokable with the runtime's actual call shapes, not
  just be present by name

`RuntimeManager` also hardens the execution boundary at call time. Backend
exceptions and invalid lifecycle return payloads are converted into structured
runtime diagnostics instead of surfacing as unhandled crashes.

## Current Scope

The current runtime scope includes:

- compiler
- planner
- runtime manager
- registry
- honest in-memory stubs
- tests and docs

Real Docker/cloud/simulation backends can be built later on top of this
contract surface.
