# SDL Limitations & Future Work

## Known Expressiveness Gaps

These are things the SDL cannot currently express, identified through stress-testing against 19 real-world scenarios from 8 platforms.

### Deployment-Layer Gaps (by design — belong in backend implementations)

These are intentionally excluded from the specification layer:

- **Port mappings** (host:container exposure) — deployment detail
- **Volume mounts** — deployment detail
- **Linux capabilities** (NET_RAW, SYS_ADMIN) — deployment detail
- **Security options** (seccomp, cgroup) — deployment detail
- **Docker Compose profiles** — deployment-specific grouping
- **Image build contexts** (Dockerfile paths) — deployment detail
- **Container entrypoints/commands** — deployment detail
- **Extra hosts** (/etc/hosts overrides) — deployment detail
- **Ulimits** (nofile, memlock) — deployment detail

These remain outside the language itself and are addressed by backend
implementations rather than by the SDL surface.

### Specification-Layer Gaps (future SDL work)

These are things that *should* be expressible in the SDL but aren't yet:

| Gap | Description | Candidate Precedent |
|-----|-------------|-------------------|
| **Hosted registry operations / ecosystem distribution** | OCI-backed module resolution, lockfiles, trust policy, and publishable image-layout packaging now exist, but operating a shared registry service, signer distribution, and ecosystem-wide discovery policy are still future work | Terraform registry, OCI artifact delivery |
| **Manual compensation APIs / advanced rollback patterns** | SDL workflows now support explicit automatic compensation targets, reverse-completion rollback ordering, and cancel/timeout/failure compensation observation, but not manual rollback triggers, nested compensation-of-compensation, or richer exception-style recovery surfaces | CACAO v2.0 workflow types, saga compensation patterns |
| **Temporal operators** | STIX-style FOLLOWEDBY/WITHIN for time-ordered event assertions | STIX Patterning Language |
| **Full time and clock model** | The SDL currently exposes timelines, timeouts, and budget-like controls, but it does not yet provide a full authoring surface for time domains, clock authority, pacing/dilation policy, synchronization mode, or explicit ordering/deadline semantics across different realizations | [Time and simulation research set](../../../research/primary/literature/time-and-simulation/README.md), ROS 2 Clock and Time, FMI, ns-3 realtime, DEVS/time-management literature |
| **Full solver-backed verification** | Global proof-style verification that attack paths are reachable and defenses are consistent is still future work; today the repo adopts lightweight semantic modeling, invariants, typed contracts, and selective property/state-machine methods instead | VSDL SMT solver, CRACK Datalog |
| **Full participant behavior surface** | The current `agents` section still under-expresses richer role-neutral behavior concerns such as tool/affordance declarations, control-context assets, decision-surface exposure policies, episode structure, and benchmark-oriented participant assets | CybORG, OpenRange, Open Trajectory Gym |
| **Scenario-native observability and authored evidence requirements** | The ecosystem now treats in-world observability systems and authored “capture these data from these sources” requirements as first-class concerns, but the current SDL syntax does not yet surface the full required authoring model | OpenRange, OCSF-informed telemetry models |
| **User behavior profiles** | Normal user activity patterns (browsing, email, file access schedules) | CybORG Green agents |
| **Multi-tenancy** | Multiple independent exercises sharing infrastructure | Locked Shields team-per-subnet model |

### Ecosystem-Layer Gaps (outside pure SDL syntax)

Some of the newest requirement work is intentionally broader than SDL syntax
alone. These concerns are now first-class ecosystem requirements, but they are
not yet fully materialized as published contracts and implementations:

- participant-implementation manifests for agents, policies, scripts, and
  human-control proxies
- participant-implementation provenance and exposure disclosure in run records
- fully materialized evidence-capture, augmentation-disclosure, and
  participant-exposure contract surfaces

These are not examples of backend leakage into the SDL. They are ecosystem
surfaces that sit alongside the SDL and must remain distinct from authored
scenario meaning.

### Variable Resolution

Variables (`${var_name}`) are stored as literal strings in the model. They are **not** resolved at parse time. This means:

- The validator can confirm that a full-value `${var}` reference has a matching variable definition
- Cross-reference rules that depend on a placeholder's final concrete value are deferred to the repo-owned instantiation phase
- Selected leaf enum-backed property fields are parameterizable, but discriminant/schema-shaping enums and user-defined mapping keys are still concrete
- Type checking of substituted runtime values happens during repo-owned instantiation, before compilation/runtime planning

This is a deliberate design choice (matching CACAO's model), but substitution
semantics are now owned by the repo rather than left to backend-specific
interpretation.

## What Has Been Validated

The SDL has been tested against 19 scenarios from 8 platforms:

| # | Scenario | Source | Nodes | Services | Vulns |

| 2 | CybORG CAGE-1 | CAGE Challenge 1 | 7 | - | 2 |
| 3 | CybORG CAGE-2 (13-host) | CAGE Challenge 2 | 16 | - | 5 |

Additionally, a 28-node enterprise lab topology (4 networks, 17 health checks, 17 vulnerabilities) has been described in SDL and validated.

Property-based fuzz testing (Hypothesis) has run 1,050+ random inputs through the parser with zero unhandled crashes.
