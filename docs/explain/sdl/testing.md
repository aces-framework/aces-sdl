# SDL Testing

The SDL and runtime stack use a layered testing strategy. Under the repository's
[coding standards](../reference/coding-standards.md), not every change needs
formal methods, but semantic and stateful changes should add the smallest
adequate artifacts for their classification level.

## Testing Ladder

Use the smallest level that matches the change:

1. **Unit tests** — parser/model/validator/compiler/planner behavior
2. **Property-based tests** — generated inputs and invariant preservation
3. **Semantic invariant tests** — explicit valid/invalid behavior for
   cross-reference, graph, visibility, or portability rules
4. **Abstract models for FM3 work** — optional state-machine/TLA+/Alloy support
   for especially risky control or contract semantics

Formal tools are not part of the default developer loop or CI in this first
rollout. They are optional artifacts for selected `FM3` changes rather than a
blanket requirement for SDL work.

## Test Suites

### Unit Tests (standard run)

```bash
pytest tests/test_sdl_models.py tests/test_sdl_validator.py \
       tests/test_sdl_parser.py -v
```

Tests structural validation (Pydantic models), semantic validation (cross-reference checks), and parser behavior (normalization, shorthands, SDL-only format boundary).
The unit suites also cover OCR-derived duration grammar, workflow graphs, direct service/ACL target refs, and `${var}` placeholder handling across supported scalar/reference fields including selected leaf enums.

### Stress Tests (standard run)

```bash
pytest tests/test_sdl_stress.py tests/test_sdl_realworld.py -v
```

19 scenarios from 8 platforms testing expressiveness boundaries:

- **test_sdl_stress.py** — Scenarios 1-13: OCR, CybORG, CALDERA, Atomic Red Team, CyRIS, KYPO, HTB, Enterprise AD, Cloud Hybrid, Exchange+data, CybORG+agents, AD+trust+federation
- **test_sdl_realworld.py** — Scenarios 14-19: Incalmo Equifax, NICE Challenge 17, CCDC Burnsodyne, HTB Offshore-style, Metasploitable 2, Locked Shields IT/OT/SCADA

Objective coverage is exercised in the stress suites as well: the agent-heavy CybORG-derived scenarios and exercise-heavy scenarios now include declarative `objectives` so the section is tested against realistic combinations of agents, scoring, orchestration, and team structure rather than only unit tests.

Those suites cover the SDL/runtime surfaces that are currently materialized in
syntax and code. They do not yet imply full executable coverage for every
participant-, benchmark-, evidence-, or participant-implementation requirement
now captured in the requirements architecture. As those surfaces become
published syntax or contracts, they should gain their own explicit fixture and
conformance coverage rather than being assumed covered indirectly.

Each scenario is tested for:
1. Parse + validate success
2. Infrastructure cross-reference integrity
3. Non-trivial content (at least 1 VM)

### Fuzz Tests (manual trigger only)

```bash
pytest tests/test_sdl_fuzz.py -m fuzz -v
```

Property-based testing using [Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/). Generates ~1,050 random inputs per run across 6 fuzz strategies:

| Test | Strategy | Examples |
|------|----------|----------|
| `test_valid_sdl_never_crashes` | Structurally plausible SDL scenarios | 200 |
| `test_arbitrary_text_never_crashes` | Completely random text | 500 |
| `test_extra_fields_rejected_cleanly` | Scenarios with unknown fields | 50 |
| `test_fuzz_service_ports` | Random port/protocol/name combos | 100 |
| `test_fuzz_vulnerability_class_validation` | Random CWE class strings | 100 |
| `test_fuzz_feature_dependency_cycles` | Random dependency graphs | 100 |

The invariant: the parser **never** raises an unhandled exception. Every input either produces a valid `Scenario` or raises `SDLParseError`/`SDLValidationError`.

Fuzz tests are excluded from the standard `pytest` run via the `fuzz` marker. They take ~70 seconds.

### Full Suite

```bash
# Standard tests (excludes fuzz)
pytest tests/ -v

# Everything including fuzz
pytest tests/ -m '' -v
```

### Example Scenarios

The `examples/` directory now contains curated large SDL files that are
meant to be reusable starting points rather than inline test-only
fixtures. They are loaded directly from disk by `tests/test_scenarios.py`
so they stay valid as real SDL artifacts:

- `hospital-ransomware-surgery-day.sdl.yaml`
- `satcom-release-poisoning.sdl.yaml`
- `port-authority-surge-response.sdl.yaml`

The up-front design briefs for the new complex examples live in
[`docs/sdl/complex-scenarios.md`](complex-scenarios.md).

Those example files now also serve as disk-backed coverage for the newest SDL surfaces: enum-backed variable values, direct service/ACL objective targets, and the redesigned workflow language (`decision`, `retry`, explicit join barriers, failure transitions, and workflow state predicates, including post-join branch-state inspection). The runtime/compiler unit suites additionally pin fail-closed behavior for missing same-node feature dependencies and malformed backend lifecycle payloads.

For workflow and runtime semantics specifically, prefer explicit invariant tests
that name the semantic rule being protected. Property-based tests are a strong
fit when the graph/state space can be generated cheaply. Abstract models become
appropriate only for `FM3` changes that materially alter branching, join,
re-entry, or portable result-contract behavior.

The same discipline should apply to newer ecosystem surfaces as they mature:
participant exposure/visibility boundaries, evidence-capture disclosures,
apparatus augmentation, and participant-implementation manifests should each
acquire named invariant tests or conformance fixtures once they are formalized
as syntax or contracts.

## Adding New Scenarios

To test a new scenario topology, add a YAML string constant to `test_sdl_stress.py` or `test_sdl_realworld.py` and add it to the `SCENARIOS` list. The parametrized tests will automatically pick it up.

The scenario should exercise specific SDL features you want to validate. Include comments noting what aspect is being tested.
