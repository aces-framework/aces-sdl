# Glossary

This glossary is a reference aid. Normative definitions remain in `specs/`,
published schemas, source code, and ADRs.

## Authoring And SDL

**ACES SDL**
: The YAML-based scenario description language implemented in this repository.
  It starts from the Open Cyber Range SDL surface and adds ACES-specific
  sections and semantics. See [Open Cyber Range SDL](https://documentation.opencyberrange.ee/docs/sdl/).

**SDL document**
: A YAML document with a required `name`, optional composition fields, and up
  to 21 named SDL sections.

**Authored scenario meaning**
: The scenario and experiment intent encoded in SDL before processor
  instantiation, compilation, planning, or backend realization.

**Scenario**
: The authored topology, services, accounts, content, relationships,
  participants, objectives, workflows, and evaluation material described by an
  SDL document.

**Experiment**
: The evaluation context around a scenario, including objectives, workflows,
  observations, results, evidence, and provenance.

**Section**
: A top-level SDL mapping such as `nodes`, `infrastructure`, `features`,
  `conditions`, `relationships`, `agents`, `objectives`, `workflows`, or
  `variables`.

**Module**
: A publishable SDL unit with `id`, `version`, optional parameters, exports,
  and description.

**Import**
: A reference from one SDL module to another module source. Current source
  classes are `local:`, `oci:`, and `locked:`.

**Variable**
: A declared value placeholder for attribute values on already-declared SDL
  objects. Variables do not create or rename mapping keys. The variable lineage
  includes CACAO playbook variables. See [CACAO Security Playbooks v2.0](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cacao/security-playbooks/v2.0/security-playbooks-v2.0.pdf).

**Relationship**
: A typed directed edge between named scenario elements. The section is adapted
  from STIX relationship objects. See [STIX 2.1](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/stix-v2.1.html).

**Agent**
: An autonomous scenario participant declaration with action, knowledge, and
  scope fields. The section is informed by CybORG agent-facing scenario
  material. See [CybORG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.09118).

**Objective**
: A declarative experiment task binding actors, targets, timing, and success
  criteria.

**Workflow**
: A control graph over objectives and workflow steps. ACES workflow semantics
  are owned by this repository; CACAO is prior art for playbook workflow
  structure. See [CACAO Security Playbooks v2.0](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cacao/security-playbooks/v2.0/security-playbooks-v2.0.pdf).

## Processing And Contracts

**Processor**
: The layer that instantiates SDL, compiles runtime models, plans changes,
  validates apparatus capabilities, and coordinates live control-plane
  operations.

**Instantiation**
: The repo-owned pass that applies explicit parameter values and SDL variable
  defaults, rejects unresolved placeholders, and produces a concrete scenario.

**Runtime model**
: The typed compiled representation used by the processor after validation and
  instantiation.

**Execution plan**
: The processor output that reconciles a runtime model against a backend
  manifest and runtime snapshot.

**Provisioning plan**
: The execution-plan portion for deployable resources and bindings.

**Orchestration plan**
: The execution-plan portion for events, scripts, stories, workflows, and
  inject state.

**Evaluation plan**
: The execution-plan portion for condition bindings, scoring graph nodes, and
  objectives.

**Runtime snapshot**
: The typed state model used by the planner and manager to represent current
  runtime resources, dependencies, and statuses.

**Backend**
: An apparatus surface that realizes scenario targets against infrastructure,
  emulation, simulation, or stubs. This repository includes backend contracts,
  stubs, and conformance checks; it does not include a production cyber-range
  backend.

**Manifest**
: A machine-readable declaration of an apparatus surface's identity,
  compatibility, realization support, constraints, and capabilities.

**Portable contract**
: A language-neutral contract intended to preserve meaning across processors,
  backends, participants, and live execution surfaces.

**Control plane**
: The live execution surface implemented by the current processor layer for
  processor-managed operations, statuses, workflow results, evaluation
  results, and history streams.

**Participant implementation**
: An agent, policy, script, or human-control proxy that consumes participant
  contracts during a run. This surface is architecture-level in the current
  repository and is not fully materialized as published schemas.

**Reference implementation**
: The Python implementation under `implementations/python/`. It is the current
  executable implementation for parsing, validation, instantiation,
  compilation, planning, control-plane contracts, stubs, and conformance
  checks.

## Evidence, Authority, And Reference Material

**Live runtime state**
: Operational state used during planning, control, observation, or execution.

**Evidence artifact**
: A recorded observation, result, history event, or related output used to
  evaluate or compare runs.

**Provenance**
: Metadata that records source, transformation, runtime, apparatus, or evidence
  origin needed to interpret a scenario or run result.

**Authority boundary**
: The repository policy that identifies which roots carry normative authority
  and which roots provide implementation, explanation, or support material.

**Normative spec**
: A document under `specs/` that defines repository semantics independent of a
  single implementation.

**ADR**
: An architecture decision record under `docs/decisions/adrs/`.

**Formal artifact**
: A specification, invariant set, or model under `specs/formal/` used for
  semantic or stateful subsystem reasoning.

**Concept authority**
: The repository layer that binds recurrent concept families, controlled
  vocabularies, reference models, and semantic profiles to explicit authority
  records.

**Backend conformance**
: The contract and fixture discipline used to check that backend-facing
  declarations and results satisfy published ACES contracts.

**Apparatus**
: The processor, backend, participant, live execution, evidence, and provenance
  surfaces around an authored scenario.
