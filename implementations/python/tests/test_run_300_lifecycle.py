"""RUN-300: end-to-end processing-model lifecycle integrity tests.

RUN-300 ("Processing Model and Lifecycle") requires that the ecosystem
carry a valid scenario through instantiation, compilation, planning,
execution, and live observation while preserving scenario meaning across
those stages.

The existing per-stage tests (``test_fm2_semantics``, ``test_runtime_*``)
each verify a single stage or a single stage pair. The tests in this
module thread one parameterized scenario through all five stages end to
end, and assert that the canonical identity chosen at instantiation time
survives unchanged into the compiled model, the planner provenance tuple,
the applied snapshot, and the live-observation envelope — and that any
drift of that provenance is rejected rather than silently reconciled.
