"""Shared Source reference type.

A Source identifies an artifact (VM image, package, template) by
name and version. Supports shorthand (bare string) and longhand
(name + version dict) forms matching OCR SDL conventions.

The Source is backend-agnostic: it could reference a Docker image,
VM template, OVA, AMI, or any provider-specific artifact. Resolution
is delegated to the deployment backend.
