"""Agent models — autonomous participants in the scenario.

Adapted from CybORG's Agents section. An agent has a role (from
entities), available actions, initial authenticated access (via
accounts), initial knowledge of the environment, and network
scope constraints.

The SDL specifies *what's available* to each agent, not *how*
the agent executes. Framework bindings (Gymnasium, PettingZoo)
are a deployment-layer concern.
