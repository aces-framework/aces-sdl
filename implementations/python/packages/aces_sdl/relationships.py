"""Relationship models — typed directed edges between scenario elements.

Adapted from STIX 2.1 Relationship SROs and OCR's dependency patterns.
Provides a general-purpose mechanism for expressing how services,
nodes, and accounts relate to each other — authentication chains,
trust relationships, federation, and connectivity.

This is how identity emerges in the SDL: accounts describe *who*,
features describe *what provides auth*, and relationships describe
*how they connect*.
